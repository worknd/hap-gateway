            Enable Keep Alive on Controller Sessions so that stale connections do not stay
            open indefinitely. Note that the HomeKit Specs do not allow this and so, this
            should be enabled at your own risk. Even without this option, the HomeKit core
            will close stale session using the HTTP Server's Least Recently Used (LRU) purge
            logic.
